# Rotation-of-curve-of-Milky-Way
Using 21 cm line observation data from SALSA and HIP4I, We try to estimate the rotation curve of inner part of Milky Way Galaxy
The data of Velocity w.r.t LSR  v/s intensity of line is in .txt format.
A rotation curve of milky is also plotted using Galpy module of python and Milky Way like potential with Central Black hole correction to it as suggested by Jo Bovy, 2015
